# ProjectManagement Tool App

ProjectManagement Tool App is an application designed to simplify the complexities of managing various aspects of projects. The tool will serve as a centralized hub where users can seamlessly manage projects, tasks, and team collaborations.

With courtesy of Breno Batista Machado for developing the application, I used the opportunity to go through the tutorials in developing this application and learn full-stack on react and c#.
